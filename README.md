Repository by Matteo Malucchi for the exam of Hadron Collider Physics (Unipi).

- Inside the "plots" directory, each subdirectory contains the complete set of plots created for that specific region.
- Inside the "images" directory can be found the images used in the report.
- Inside the "atlas-demo-HZZ" directory there is the code used for the analysis. The majority of the code was taken from [atlas-outreach-cpp-framework-13tev](https://github.com/atlas-outreach-data-tools/atlas-outreach-cpp-framework-13tev).
- The jupyter notebook `ATLAS-Open-Data-Python-13-TeV-framework-script-HZZ-analysis` allows to run the analysis.
